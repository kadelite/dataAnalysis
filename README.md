### Key Insights from COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

1. **Vaccination Disparities**: Developed nations like the United States and United Kingdom achieved much higher vaccination rates (>60%) compared to developing countries like Kenya (<10%) as of [latest date].

2. **Case Trends**: Countries experienced multiple waves of infections, with some (like India) showing particularly severe spikes in mid-2021.

3. **Death Rates**: Countries with stronger healthcare systems (e.g., Germany) maintained lower death rates despite high case numbers, demonstrating the importance of healthcare capacity.

4. **Vaccination Impact**: In countries with early vaccine rollout (UK, US), case numbers showed significant decline following widespread vaccination.

5. **Regional Patterns**: African nations generally reported lower case numbers but this may reflect differences in testing capacity rather than actual infection rates.
